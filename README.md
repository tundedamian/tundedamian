# Hi, I'm Damian Ogedengbe — DevOps Engineer | Cloud Enthusiast | Automation Advocate

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a passionate DevOps Engineer focused on building scalable infrastructure, automating deployment pipelines, and improving developer experience. I thrive at the intersection of development and operations — where reliability meets speed.

##  What I Do

**Infrastructure as Code**
Terraform, Ansible, AWS CloudFormation — I believe in automating everything.

 **CI/CD Pipelines**  
Built with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI — smooth, reliable delivery.

 **Cloud Architecture & Deployment**  
AWS | Azure | GCP — from EC2 to EKS, I deploy robust cloud-native solutions.

 **Containerization & Orchestration**  
Docker, Kubernetes — I containerize apps and orchestrate them for performance and scalability.

 **Monitoring & Security**  
Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, AWS CloudWatch — visibility is key.
